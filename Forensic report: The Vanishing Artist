###Discussion: 
 The deceased, Marcus Eldridge, was found in his disorganized studio after a disturbance. The wounds (Faint bruising on the ribs, 3 cm lacerating on forearm), and blood on the window.  disheveled hair indicates the struggle of unsuccesful escape. According to the examinations, the victim was slightly malnourisished— making him more vulnerable. Along with trauma on the victim’s ribs, slight blood loss, mild subdural hematoma— combined with malnutrition and no medical intervention lead to brain herniation which ultimately caused his death.

Prior to death, the victim’s condition was likely compromised due to neglecting self-care (Indicated by the long working hours, abandoned canvases, not collecting mails and slight malnutrition) and this became a contributing factor in his death later on. The offender likely knew this and took advantage of his weakened condition.

Taken together, the result of mild subdural hematoma amplified by malnutrition leads to a set up for brain herniation leading to cardiac arrest. The manner of death is best classified as homicide, with no strong forensic support for accidental or suicide.





###Cause of death: Brainstem failure due to herniation
###Mechanism of Death: Pressure in the skull rises due to subdural hematoma →Brain herniation enhanced with malnutrition and hypoxia→ Brainstem failure→ Cardiac arrest
###Manner of Death: Homicide

###Evidence Supporting Homicide: 
-The abrasions on the knuckles were likely from the victim’s vigorous attempt to defend himself from the offender— consistent with dried blood on the window and victim’s placement during death.
-The offender was also possibly aware of the victim’s weakened physical and emotional condition due to malnutrition and stress, and exploited.
-Prior to death, the victim was actively painting before getting caught up in the sudden, unexpected event— proved by the paint on the victim’s clothing and upper limbs.
